TROUBLESHOOTING

Issue: 503 Service Unavailable
Solution:
- Ensure all microservices are running
- Check Eureka dashboard to verify service registration
- Verify database connection

Issue: Database Connection Refused
Solution:
- Ensure MySQL is running: docker ps
- Check database credentials in configuration
- Verify port 3306 is accessible

Issue: CORS Errors
Solution:
- Verify API Gateway CORS configuration
- Check frontend URL is in allowed origins
- Restart API Gateway service

Issue: Authentication Failed
Solution:
- Verify JWT token is stored in localStorage
- Check token hasn't expired
- Ensure password is correct
- Verify email exists in database


MAINTENANCE

Database Backup
mysqldump -u root -proot@123 auth_service_db > backup.sql

Restore Database
mysql -u root -proot@123 auth_service_db < backup.sql

Viewing Logs
docker logs <container-name>
docker logs -f <container-name>

Restarting Services
docker-compose restart
docker-compose restart <service-name>


PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

Caching
- Redis can be integrated for session caching
- Response caching at API Gateway level

Database
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling with HikariCP

Frontend
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Memoization of expensive components
- Debouncing API calls


SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

1. Authentication
- All endpoints (except /auth/register and /auth/login) require JWT token
- Tokens expire after configured duration

2. Data Encryption
- Passwords hashed with BCrypt
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest

3. API Security
- CORS configured to allow only trusted origins
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

4. Environment
- Sensitive credentials in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Two-factor authentication
- Mobile application
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced ML-based recommendations
- Export reports to PDF/Excel
- Multi-currency support
- Budget alerts and notifications
- Social features (share goals with friends)
- Integration with banking APIs
